<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Airport De-icing Vehicles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spreader</li><li>Sprayer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The airport de-icing vehicles market consists primarily of two types: spreaders and sprayers. Spreaders are designed to evenly distribute solid de-icing agents, such as salt or sand, across runway surfaces, enhancing traction and melting ice. In contrast, sprayers utilize liquid de-icing solutions, typically glycol or other chemicals, to effectively remove ice and snow from aircraft surfaces and runways. Both types play crucial roles in ensuring safety and operational efficiency during winter conditions at airports.</p></p>
