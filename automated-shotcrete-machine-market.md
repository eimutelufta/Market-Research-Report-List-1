<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automated Shotcrete Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Shotcrete</li><li>Dry Shotcrete</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automated Shotcrete Machine market is primarily segmented into two types: wet shotcrete and dry shotcrete. Wet shotcrete involves the mixing of concrete with water before it is sprayed, allowing for better adhesion and faster application, making it ideal for tunneling and underground structures. Dry shotcrete, on the other hand, involves the dry mix being propelled through a nozzle and then mixed with water at the exit point, offering precise control and reduced waste, often used in repair and rehabilitation projects.</p></p>
