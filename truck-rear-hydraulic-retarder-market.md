<p><strong>The Truck Rear Hydraulic Retarder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Parallel Hydraulic Retarder</li><li>Tandem Hydraulic Retarder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Truck Rear Hydraulic Retarder market includes two main types: Parallel and Tandem Hydraulic Retarders. Parallel Hydraulic Retarders function by utilizing hydraulic fluid to create resistance, helping to slow down the vehicle without involving the brakes directly for better wear management. Conversely, Tandem Hydraulic Retarders consist of two linked systems that provide additional braking force, making them suitable for heavier loads and steep descents. Both designs enhance vehicle safety and reduce brake wear during long-duration drives.</p></p>
